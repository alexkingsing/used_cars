    **The process under which an algorithm, based on repeated data and statistic principles, 'learns' a task.** Abstract, right?
    So what does it *truly mean*? Let's try with an example! \n
(1) If I tell you that we have an animal with four legs and a tail, can you classify what animal this is?
most likely no, it could be a cat or a dog, or even horse, right? \n
(2) Then let's say I now tell you that this animal has white hair, can you figure it out now? \n
(3) Finally, let's say the animal weights 500 KG, do you know what is now? \n
